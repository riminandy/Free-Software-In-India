<p>The ideology that drives the FOSS community is freedom from the controlling monopoly of the technology giants. The community strives to make the technology of computing available to the "non professionals". Working together as a community, coding, modifying and distribuing leads to a higher standard of computing. The FOSS community acts as the pool where the best brains gather to create and recreate for the benefit of the society at large. These are the common ideals shared by the community. But the ideals are not the only motivation for the functioning of the FOSS community.The motivations driving the movement forward can be categorised into two sections:</p>
<strong><li><u>Intrinsic Motivation:</u></li></strong>
<p> This kind of motivation is closely linked to the sense of self satisfaction. In this case, a person performs a task for the sake of gaining pleasure and enjoyment out of the performance of the task.It evokes the sense of accomplishment, intelligent stimulation and creativity. One person working under the influence of <em> Intrinsic Motivation</em> is Linus Trovalds, whose main motivation was the desire to become a part of a community with which he could identify himself.</p>

<strong><li><u>Extrinsic Motivation:</u></li></strong>

This type of motivation is closely linked to the pleasure gained from peer recognition and fame.Learning better coding skills for acheiving better standing among the peers, recognition of individuals level of intelligence leading to increasing the value of a person in the job market.</p>

<p>Various Software Companies also get motivated to work on the development of Free Software as it gives them access to higher level technology. It also helps in recreating their identity as a non profit making company.</p>

<p>These are the common motivations that create the base for FOSS movement. The reasons might vary from country to country making FOSS use and development a culture specific act.</p>
