#<blockquote>"We make joy a crime against the State"</blockquote>
<p><em> Massachusetts Institute of Technology</em> -a place of dreams and realities which interacted to plant the seed for the birth of the phenomenon known as the Free and Open Source Software.The ideology behind the Free and Open Source Software were first wheeled out in the year 1958-59.A group of enthusiastic youths, first realised the joy of coding using the giant and cumbersome IBM machines which were used for mathematical calculations. The forerunner to the modern computer language, are the punch cards used to feed instructions to the computing machines. The people who first started using these to hack codes belonged to the Tech Model Railroad Club. The biggest challenge for these youths was to write a set of instructions using the least number of commands. The keycards prepared after devoting hours on end would be kept for the use of anybody else who wished to use. With the entry of the TX-0 from the Lincoln Lab, the Punch Cards gave way to the Flexowriter. Life for the Hackers became easier as they were not deterred by the restrictions that surrounded the use of IBM 704.
