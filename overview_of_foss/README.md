###### <h1><blockquote>Free as in Freedom</blockquote></h1>

<p><em>Free and Open Source Software</em>- where did it all start, what inspired it, how was it born, these facts are important for one and all to know inorder to truly get the sense of what this form of software stands for and strives to acheive.</p>
<p><em>Free Software</em> was born out of the unsatiated hunger of a group of youths in MIT to create and modify computer codes continuosly thereby creating a decentralised system which could further creativity. To create, modify and distribute, to make technology available to the masses- these ideas drove them to lay the foundations for what would later be taken up by Richard Stallman to form the <strong>Free Software Foundation</strong></p>
<p>The meaning of the terms Free Software and Open Software is correctly known by a very small percentage of the population. Most people in India connect the terms to availability ofthe softwares without making any payments for its use. For a large section of the population the terms <em> Free Software, Open Source Software, Freeware and Pirated software</em> does not differ in any way.</p>
<p>The first step to understanding the concept of Free Software is to learn to distinguish between the four terms mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>But first the conceptual difference between Proprietery Software and Free Software.</p>
<li><strong>
Proprietary Software:</strong></li><p> This is the most prevalent software in India today. Almost all Laptops and Desktops in India comes preloaded with Microsoft Windows, the forerunners among the Proprietary software. The main basis for this type of software is that the language code or the <em>source code</em>used to write the software is kept hidden by the respective companies.This hidden <em>Source Code</em> is considered to be the tool of success for the companies. This gives the companies total control over the manner in which the softwares can be used by the consumers.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>
Freeware:</strong></li><p> Most of the Proprietary Softwares are paid softwares. But there are a few which are avaialable for free, though their source codes still remain a secret. These types of Softwares are called Freeware. <em>Skype</em> is one such Freeware.</p>
<li><strong>
Pirated Software:</strong></li><p>This type of software is again proprietary software which have been cracked illegally and distributed among willing consumers who wish to use the software without having to pay exorbitant price for it.</p>
